When used in this Agreement, the following terms shall have the respective meanings indicated, such
meanings to be applicable to both the singular and plural forms of the terms defined:
"Acceptance" of Software means completion of the acceptance testing process set forth in Section 3
of this Agreement.
"Agreement" includes this agreement and its Schedules and Riders.
"Delivery Date" is the date on which Licensor ships the Software to Licensee.
"Designated Environment" means the computer equipment and software operating system
described on Schedule C.
"Documentation" means the user, system, and installation documentation for the Software.
"Error" means a material failure of the Software to function in conformity with the Specifications.
"License" means the license granted by Licensor to Licensee to use the Software and Documentation
in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement.
"Licensed Copies" means the number of copies of the Software and Documentation being licensed
to the Licensee.
"Location(s)" means Licensee's offices at the location(s) specified in Schedule D.
"Maintenance Agreement" means the Software Maintenance Agreement between the parties
effective as of the date of this Agreement.

Comment [1]: Many companies seem to believe
that there is a single form agreement circulating
among software lawyers with the perfect terms that
can just be cut and pasted into their agreements if
they can just find the right attorney who can furnish
that “perfect” form agreement. The reality, of course,
is that merely cutting and pasting from a form
agreement—even a very well-written form
agreement—is precisely the wrong way to draft this
type of agreement. While there absolutely are
standard terms that you will find in all software
agreements—whether SaaS or software licenses—
which may form the basis of high quality software
templates for either the software license or SaaS
model, a well-drafted contract is more than just an
assortment of the “right” terms. Instead, it reflects
the actual product offering to customers.
Comment [2]: If you are primarily
providing software through a browser, but there is
some software downloaded, then you probably need
a Subscription Services Agreement, as you really are
in the SAAS business. However, if you are primarily
providing software that will be downloaded, but
there are some services provided (maybe support,
maintenance, training, or web services), then you
probably need an EULA, as you are in the business
of licensing your software. Also, some models may
be more of a true hybrid, with a SAAS agreement for
your online subscription service, and then an EULA ... [1]
Comment [3]: For financial reasons, the licensor
may want to restrict the definition of licensee. The
broader the definition of the licensee, the more
entities or individuals who will have access to and
use of the licensed software, thus reducing the
potential license fees a licensor may receive. Some
license agreements allow affiliates of the licensee to
utilize the licensed software. Many such agreements
define "affiliates" to include only the licensee's
parent company and those subsidiaries at least 51%
owned by the licensee or its parent to limit the use of
the licensed software.
Comment [4]: In the enterprise license model, a
company may purchase a license allowing a set

number of user rights. In such a model, a well-
drafted license would at least explain what

constitutes a user, how users can be added and
deleted, what rights the users have to the various
license grants made, the cost of purchasing new
users, and the cost of purchasing the initial set of
users. But the decisions on how to structure each of
these terms would be entirely dependent on the
business model and product offering made available
by the specific software company. Thus, if the terms
selected are being cut and pasted from an unrelated ... [2]
Comment [5]: In addition to limitations on how
the software may be used, geographic restrictions on
where the software may be used should also be
considered when drafting software license
agreements. Most licensors limit the use of software
to a specific country or site. Failure to limit the use
of the software to a particular country or geographic
site may also give rise to a number of export issues.
Furthermore, geographic scope limitation is closely
tied to intellectual property rights indemnification.
Failure to include a geographic restriction for the
licensed software's use may expand the scope of
indemnification granted by the Licensor. ... [3]

"Price" means the License Fees Licensee shall pay as specified in Schedule B.
"Rider" refers to any riders attached to this Agreement, or any subsequently prepared document
which the parties agree in writing to be considered a Rider.
"Schedule" refers to any schedule attached to this Agreement, or any subsequently prepared
document which the parties agree in writing to be considered a Schedule.
"Software" means the computer programs specified in Schedule A in machine-readable, object code
form, and any computer programs delivered to Licensee in machine-readable, object code form as
Maintenance Releases and Product Releases (as these terms are defined in the Maintenance
Agreement).
"Specifications" means Licensor's current published Product Release Definitions.
"Target Date" means the date set forth by which parties anticipate delivery of the Software.
"Warranty Period" means [NUMBER] days from the date of Acceptance.
2. SOFTWARE LICENSE
2.1 License
Licensor grants Licensee a non-exclusive, non-transferable license to (1) use the Software and
Documentation solely for its internal operations at the Location(s) and on the Designated
Environment, and (2) copy the Software and Documentation for archival or backup purposes only,
provided that all titles, trademarks, and copyright, proprietary and restricted rights notices shall be
reproduced in all such copies, and that all copies shall be subject to the terms of this Agreement.
2.2 Distribution
Except as explicitly provided herein, Licensee shall not: (1) make available nor distribute all or part of
the Software or Documentation to any third party by assignment, sublicense, or by any other means;
(2) copy, adapt, reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, or modify, in whole or in part, any of the
Software or Documentation; or (3) use the Software to operate in or as a time-sharing, outsourcing, or
service bureau environment, or in any way allow third party access to the Software.
3. INSTALLATION AND ACCEPTANCE
Licensor shall use reasonable efforts to deliver the Licensed Copies of the Software and Documentation
to the Location(s) on or about the Target Date. Licensee shall have [NUMBER] days from the Delivery
Date to perform acceptance testing. Licensee's Acceptance of the Software shall occur at the earlier of
Licensee's operational use of the Software, or the expiration of [NUMBER] days from the Delivery Date
without the provision of notice by Licensee to Licensor of any Error(s). If Licensee provides notice to
Licensor of any Error(s) and Licensor verifies the alleged Error(s), the Software shall be accepted upon
Licensor's correction of such Error(s).
4. PRICE AND PAYMENT
4.1 Price
Licensee shall pay the Price in accordance with the payment plan set forth in Schedule B. Licensor
shall invoice any additional costs reasonably incurred by Licensor in the delivery of the Software as
they are incurred. Payment shall be made by Licensee to Licensor in full without any right of set-off or
deduction, and Licensee shall pay the Price and such costs within [NUMBER] days from the date of
invoice.

Comment [6]: A well-crafted software license or
SaaS agreement will be structured around the
technology, features, functionality, and business
model of the applicable product and will not be
based merely on a set of “perfect” terms from any
template. As a software company, that means that if
you retain an attorney to advise you on your
contracts, your attorney should absolutely be pushing
you to provide significant details about how the
technology, features, functionality, and business
model of your product work, among other issues!

Comment [7]: The first paragraph of any story
should follow the “who, what, when, and where”
convention. A well-crafted license agreement will
follow this methodology, too. We will make sure the
business elements of the deal (what is being
licensed, the cost of the license, and the scope and
duration of the license) are included right after the
definitions section. You will be happy to know that
the principal business elements of the deal are
addressed near the front of the agreement, avoiding
the need to pour over page after page to find the
price of the software or the payment terms.
Comment [8]: A well-drafted license agreement

will state whether the license is perpetual, non-
assignable, exclusive, worldwide, or enterprise-wide,

and whether it includes the software’s source code.
Comment [9]: The structural choices in how
these kinds of agreements are drafted do not end
with the user rights. For example, there are choices
that the drafter has to make based on what type of
data is being collected by the product, where the data
is being stored, the level of risk to the
company if the data is accessed by a third party, and
what needs to happen to the data at the end of the
relationship. Also, there are choices that need to be
made based on whether use of the product depends
on importing pre-existing data into the software and
effectively reading such data. Let us make these
choices correctly for you!

4.2 Tax
Licensee shall be responsible for any applicable sales or use taxes or any value added or similar
taxes payable with respect to the licensing of the Software, or arising out of or in connection with this
Agreement, other than taxes levied or imposed based upon Licensor's income. In the event that
Licensor pays any such taxes on behalf of Licensee, Licensor shall invoice Licensee for such taxes
and Licensee agrees to pay such taxes in accordance with this Agreement.
4.3 Interest
Failure by Licensee to pay any amounts invoiced under this Agreement in full in accordance with this
Agreement shall make Licensee liable to pay Licensor interest at the rate of [%] per month on the
remaining amount due, or at the highest amount permitted by applicable law, such interest to accrue
on a daily basis after as well as before any judgment relating to collection of the amount due.
5. PROPRIETARY RIGHTS
Licensee acknowledges and agrees that the copyright, patent, trade secret, and all other intellectual
property rights of whatever nature in the Software, Documentation and Specifications are and shall
remain the property of Licensor, and nothing in this Agreement should be construed as transferring any
aspects of such rights to Licensee or any third party.
6. CONFIDENTIALITY
6.1 Confidential Information
"Confidential Information", shall mean the Software, Documentation, Specifications, and terms and
conditions of this Agreement. Licensee acknowledges the confidential and proprietary nature of the
Confidential Information and agrees that it shall not reveal or disclose any Confidential Information for
any purpose to any other person, firm, corporation, or other entity, other than Licensee's employees
with a need to know such Confidential Information to perform employment responsibilities consistent
with Licensee's rights under this Agreement. Licensee shall safeguard and protect the Confidential
Information from theft, piracy, or unauthorized access in a manner at least consistent with the
protections Licensee uses to protect its own most confidential information. Licensee shall inform its
employees of their obligations under this Agreement, and shall take such steps as may be reasonable
in the circumstances, or as may be reasonably requested by Licensor, to prevent any unauthorized
disclosure, copying or use of the Confidential Information. Licensee acknowledges and agrees that in
the event of the Licensee's breach of this Agreement, Licensor will suffer irreparable injuries not
compensated by money damages and therefore shall not have an adequate remedy at law.
Accordingly, Licensor shall be entitled to a preliminary and final injunction without the necessity of
posting any bond or undertaking in connection therewith to prevent any further breach of these
confidentiality obligations or further unauthorized use of Confidential Information. This remedy is
separate and apart from any other remedy Licensor may have.
6.2 Unauthorized Disclosure
Licensee shall notify Licensor immediately upon discovery of any prohibited use or disclosure of the
Confidential Information, or any other breach of these confidentiality obligations by Licensee, and
shall fully cooperate with Licensor to help Licensor regain possession of the Confidential Information
and prevent the further prohibited use or disclosure of the Confidential Information.
7. WARRANTY
7.1 Operation
Licensor represents to Licensee that: (1) during the Warranty Period, the Software shall operate
without any Errors; and (2) upon notification to Licensor during the Warranty Period of any Errors,
Licensor will, during its normal business hours and at no cost to Licensee, use reasonable efforts to

Comment [10]: Have your confidentiality
provision drafted correctly! The confidentiality
provision should apply to both parties and deal with
the right of either party to have the other party keep
sensitive business or trade secret information
disclosed to it confidential. Confidentiality of the
software and documentation, on the other hand, is
better addressed in the provisions dealing with use
restrictions.
Comment [11]: Licensors must be careful to
limit the length of any warranty they give. Many
licensees request a one-year warranty. This creates a
hidden risk for the licensor as, during the warranty
period, the licensee may terminate the license
agreement and seek a refund if the licensor is in
material breach. A shorter warranty accompanied by

a maintenance period provided under a properly-
worded and separate maintenance agreement can

solve this problem.
Comment [12]: In a basic software license
agreement, vendor support of the software is likely
to consist of telephone assistance rendered by the
vendor’s help desk during normal business hours
and new releases of the software that provide minor
enhancements or bug fixes. Support is customarily
provided free of charge during the software’s
warranty period. After expiration of that period, the
vendor will charge the customer for support, and the
price is usually a percentage of the vendor’s current
software license fee. For any level of support above
a routine help desk or bug-fix obligation, which is
provided after expiration of the software warranty, a
separate support agreement should be drafted that
specifies the vendor’s support obligations, the
support fee, the performance standards (including
response times) for support, and the penalties if these
standards are not met. Care should be taken to make
sure that the software support agreement is
consistent with the license agreement.

correct such Errors which are reproducible and verifiable by Licensor, excluding any Errors caused by
uses of the Software which were not in accordance with the Specifications.
7.2 Correction
In the event that Licensee notifies Licensor of an Error during the Warranty Period, Licensor's sole
liability, and Licensee's sole remedy, will be Licensor's use of reasonable efforts to correct such
Errors or, in Licensor's sole discretion, to refund the portion of the prepaid Price applicable to the
portion of the Software which is defective.
7.3 Warranty Disclaimer
THE PARTIES AGREE THAT THE SOFTWARE'S FAILURE TO PERFORM IN ACCORDANCE
WITH THE SPECIFICATIONS SHALL NOT BE CONSIDERED A FAILURE OF THE ESSENTIAL
PURPOSE OF THE REMEDIES CONTAINED HEREIN. EXCEPT FOR THE ABOVE LIMITED
WARRANTY, THE ENTIRE RISK OF THE SOFTWARE'S QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE IS WITH
LICENSEE.
8. INDEMNITY
8.1 Indemnification
Licensor hereby indemnifies Licensee against any claim that the Software, furnished and used within
the scope of this Agreement, infringes any [COUNTRY] registered copyright or patent, provided that:
(1) Licensor is given prompt notice of the claim; (2) Licensor is given immediate and complete control
over the defense and/or settlement of the claim, and Licensee fully cooperates with Licensor in such
defense and/or settlement; (3) Licensee does not prejudice in any manner Licensor's conduct of such
claim; and (4) the alleged infringement is not based upon the use of the Software in a manner
prohibited under this Agreement, in a manner for which the Software was not designed, or in a
manner not in accordance with the Specifications.
8.2 Altered Version
Licensor shall have no liability for any claim of infringement based on (a) the use of a superseded or
altered version of the Software if infringement would have been avoided by the use of a current or
unaltered version of the Software which Licensor made available to Licensee; or (b) the combination,
operation or use of the Software with software, hardware, or other materials not furnished by
Licensor.
8.3 Injunction
If a final injunction is obtained against the use of any part of the Software by reason of infringement of
[COUNTRY] registered copyright or patent, Licensor will, at its option and expense, either (1) procure

for Licensee the right to continue to use the Software; (2) modify the Software so that it becomes non-
infringing; or (3) repurchase the Software and Documentation less depreciation at the rate of [%] per

year, or pro rata for part of the year, from the date of Acceptance to the date of removal of the
Software. If Licensor selects this third option, Licensee shall, immediately upon receipt from Licensor
of the payment set forth above, at Licensor's option destroy or return all copies of the Software and
Documentation in its possession or under its control.
8.4 Liability
The foregoing states Licensor's entire obligation and liability with respect to the infringement of any
property right.
8.5 Infringement
Licensee hereby indemnifies Licensor against any claim for (1) alleged infringement of any
[COUNTRY] registered copyright or patent, arising out of the use of the Software by Licensee in any
manner prohibited by this Agreement and (2) any claim related to or arising out of a financial
transaction brought by any third party based on the use of the Software.

Comment [13]: In any license agreement, it is
also important to include a provision granting the
licensee a monetary refund if a "repair or replace"
remedy fails of its essential purpose. If a court finds
that the licensor's warranty "failed of its essential
purpose," i.e., the licensor did not provide the
licensee with a viable remedy, some courts will void
the licensee's contractually agreed-to exclusion of
consequential damages, potentially creating
unlimited liability on the licensor's behalf.
Comment [14]: The licensor should disclaim all
warranties except those expressly made in the license
agreement. If the licensor does not disclaim all other
warranties, the licensor would be potentially liable
for the failure of the licensed software to be
merchantable or fit for the purpose for which it is
intended by the licensee.
Comment [15]: Many drafters of software
license agreements confuse indemnity provisions
with risk allocation provisions. Indemnity clauses
deal with a third-party claim or suit against one of
the contracting parties. The risk allocation section
concerns the liability of the parties to each other (as
opposed to third-party actions covered by the
indemnity provisions). Since third-party claims are
not within the contracting parties’ direct control, the
damages resulting from such claims should be dealt
with separately, and not by the risk allocation
provisions.

RELIANCE UPON, THIS ALLOCATION OF RISK AND THE EXCLUSION OF CONSEQUENTIAL
DAMAGES SET FORTH IN THIS AGREEMENT.
9.2 Force Majeure

which Licensee has agreed to pay.

Comment [16]: This section refers to limitations
on liability related to the software. In addition,
insurance provisions are important when the
software vendor is going to have its personnel
performing services at the customer’s site. This is a
distinct type of liability risk that may need to be
addressed as well.

Comment [17]: Consequences of breach may
depend on state law, and this section should always
be reviewed by an attorney who is familiar with the
contract law of your state.

Comment [18]: Warranties mean nothing
without adequate remedies. Remedies for breach of
the agreement should be adequately described. A
lawyer can help you determine what remedies may
be appropriate.
